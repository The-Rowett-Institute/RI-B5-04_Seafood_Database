# RIB504_Mapping-UK-seafood-chains
RI-B5-04. Mapping UK seafood supply chains

The overall aim of this study is to reveal how the UKâ€™s production and supply chains could be better aligned with consumption and dietary recommendations to bolster resilience, sustainability and safety, whilst optimising their nutritional impact, in working towards our ambition for net-zero emissions of all greenhouse gases by 2045. We are interested in gathering data from the past 10 years to assess how events like Brexit and the Covid epidemic have affected these supply chains.

1) FAOSTAT: Food balance sheets. Includes production, imports, exports and non-food uses
