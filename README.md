RI-B5-04. Mapping UK seafood supply chains.

Transforming our diets to build a more sustainable food system is paramount to achieving net zero. Arguably, such diets will include more seafood. We mapped seafood production (capture and aquaculture), trade (imports and exports), purchases (within and out-of-home), and seafood consumption, to species level, between 2009 and 2020, for the UK. 

The R markdown documents provided here detail how the data were cleaned and merged to create the seafood database.

Commodity and data supplier:
1)	Capture production (Marine Management Organisation)
2)	Aquaculture production (Eurostat and CEFAS)
3)	Imports and exports (HMRC) 
4)	Purchases (DEFRA family food)
5)	Consumption (National Dietary and Nutrition Survey)
